Hello! I'm Jade and I am a self-taught programmer. My love for programming started with building Discord bots in Python, but I have branched out into other areas such as Java, HTML, CSS & Javascript, with a keen interest in developing Discord bots, websites, databases and applications. I am also capable of using Git & Github, including the command line terminal, and while I prefer solo-working as that is within my comfort zone, I am excited to join a team of developers and collaboratively help with building the future of FIS.
