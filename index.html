        <p>Hello! I'm Jade and I am a self-taught programmer. My love for programming started with building databases and Discord bots in Python and Java, and more recently I have been learning website development in HTML, CSS & Javascript, with the intention of building and designing a web interface to serve as a dashboard to manage my Discord bots. I have a keen interest in developing my own skills further in the creation of Discord bots, websites, databases and applications. I am also capable of using Git & Github, including the command line terminal, push/pull requests and handling merge conflicts, and while I prefer solo-working as that is within my comfort zone, I am excited to join a team of developers and collaboratively help with building the future of FIS.</p>

      <h2>Suggestions Bot</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Coded primarily in Python with an internal Java database and occasional use of Javascript, TE Suggestions is a Discord Bot made specially for the TLOU Esports (TE) Discord Server, that was operational from 2017-2022 with 900+ members. Using Discord's integrated Modals, buttons and embeds, with minimal use of slash commands, members can post suggestions, vote on others suggestions, and staff can approve/deny suggestions with a reason and a record of the vote counts.</p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There is a bot-posted message in the Discord #suggestions channel, with a button to create a new suggestion.</li>
        <li>Clicking this button opens a Discord Modal for the user to type in their suggestion.</li>
        <li>The bot then posts an embedded message which contains the member's username, profile picture and suggestion that they typed, along with 'tick' and 'cross' voting buttons.</li>
        <li>The bot then deletes the panel message (that has the ability to create a new suggestion) and re-posts it; this creates the illusion of a 'sticky' message which remains the most recent message in the channel for easy-access to submit a new suggestion.</li>
        <li>For every new suggestion made, the bot uses a Java database to store all of the information, including the vote counts, in an internal directory.</li>
        <li>Members have the ability to change their mind during the voting phase by selecting a different button (ex: if already clicked 'tick' button, clicking the 'cross' button will remove your 'tick' vote from the bot's internal Java log and count the 'cross' instead)</li>
        <li>Members of a certain Discord server role (such as Admin members) have access to buttons to accept/deny the suggestions, with the ability to enter an optional message for the reason (via Discord Modal).</li>
        <li>Once a suggestion has been accepted/rejected, the bot will retrieve the data from the internal Java database, and post a new embedded message in the #suggestions channel which includes the username of the original suggestor, the suggestion, the vote counts of 'tick' vs 'crock', whether it was accepted or rejected, the member who accepted/rejected it, the reason (optional - if left blank, the 'reason' heading will not show), and the embed will either display a green colour if accepted or a red colour if rejected.</li>
        <li>The bot will also delete the original suggestion from the channel once an admin has finalised the result, and will also ensure the embed to create a new suggestion remains 'sticky' (deletes old post, re-posts).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This portfolio uses a publicly-available Jekyll theme for the design, but I have made it in HTML with some CSS and some attempts at Javascript. One of the images (my Habbo avatar with her back turned facing a laptop) has been made using Gimp (original images taken from online generators).</p>
