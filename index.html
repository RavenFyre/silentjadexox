      <div class="text">
        <p>Hello! I'm Jade and I am a self-taught programmer. My love for programming started with building databases and Discord bots in Python and Java, and more recently I have been learning website development in HTML, CSS & Javascript, with the intention of building and designing a web interface to serve as a dashboard to manage my Discord bots. I have a keen interest in developing my own skills further in the creation of Discord bots, websites, databases and applications. I am also capable of using Git & Github, including the command line terminal, push/pull requests and handling merge conflicts, and while I prefer solo-working as that is within my comfort zone, I am excited to join a team of developers and collaboratively help with building the future of FIS.</p>

      <h2>Portfolio Web Page</h2>
      <p>This portfolio uses a publicly-available Jekyll theme for the design, but I have made it in HTML with some CSS and some attempts at Javascript. One of the images (my Habbo avatar with her back turned facing a laptop) has been made using Gimp (original images taken from online generators).</p>

      <h2>Basic Web Page</h2>
      <p>Made via HTML & CSS and features an attempt at using Javascript, this project followed a course set out by Codeacademy in learning the basics of web development.</p>

    <div id="portal_pay_guide">
      <h2>Discord pay/portal Guide:</h2>
      An informative guide on how the pay system at FIS works and how to access the portal and use it for the purposes of claiming pay, written in entirety by me using Discord's markdown formatting.
