    <h1>A bit about me</h1>
    <div class="about-me">
      <div class="text">
        <p>Hello! I'm Jade and I am a self-taught programmer. My love for programming started with building databases and Discord bots in Python and Java, and more recently I have been learning website development in HTML, CSS & Javascript, with the intention of building and designing a web interface to serve as a dashboard to manage my Discord bots. I have a keen interest in developing my own skills further in the creation of Discord bots, websites, databases and applications. I am also capable of using Git & Github, including the command line terminal, push/pull requests and handling merge conflicts, and while I prefer solo-working as that is within my comfort zone, I am excited to join a team of developers and collaboratively help with building the future of FIS.</p>

    <div id="suggestions_bot">
      <h2>Suggestions Bot</h2>
      <p>Coded primarily in Python with an internal Java database and occasional use of Javascript, TE Suggestions is a Discord Bot made specially for the TLOU Esports (TE) Discord Server, that was operational from 2017-2022 with 900+ members.</p>
      <p>Bot features: "Sticky" panel message that remains as the most recent discord message with button to submit suggestion, form to fill out suggestion, embedded messages show the username, profile picture, and suggestion, with vote buttons for other members to vote, ability to change mind during voting (ex: if already clicked 'tick' button, clicking the 'x' button will remove your 'tick' vote and count the 'x' instead), admin buttons to approve/reject suggestions along with an optional reason. </p>
      <p>How it works: There is a bot-posted message in the Discord #suggestions channel, with a button to create a new suggestion. Clicking this button opens a form to type in their suggestion. The bot then posts the embedded message which contains the member's username, profile picture and suggestion that they typed, along with 'tick' and 'cross' voting buttons. The bot then deletes the panel message with the ability to create a new suggestion and re-posts it; this creates the illusion of a 'sticky' message which remains the most recent message in the channel for easy access to submit a new suggestion. For every new suggestion made, the bot uses a Java database to store all of the information, including the vote counts, in an internal directory. Members of a certain Discord server role (such as Admin members) have access to buttons to accept/deny the suggestions, with the ability to enter an optional message for the reason. This will mean the bot will retrieve the data from the Java database, and post a new embedded message in the #suggestions channel which includes the username of the original suggestor, the suggestion, the vote count of yay vs nay, whether it was accepted or rejected, the member who accepted/rejected it, the reason (optional - if left blank, the 'reason' heading will not show), and the embed will show with either a green colour if accepted or a red colour if rejected. The bot will also delete the original suggestion (that can be voted on) from the channel once an admin has finalised the result, and will also ensure the embed to create a new suggestion remains 'sticky' (deletes old post, re-posts).</p>

      <h2>Portfolio Web Page</h2>
      <p>This portfolio uses a publicly available Jekyll theme for the design, but I have made it in HTML with some CSS and some attempts at Javascript. One of the images (my Habbo avatar with her back turned facing a laptop) has been made using Gimp (original images taken from online generators).</p>
