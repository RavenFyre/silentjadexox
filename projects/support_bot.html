  <h1>Support Bot</h1>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <div class="support_bot">
    <div class="text">
      <p>Overview: Coded primarily in Python with an internal Java database, TE Support is a Discord Bot made specially for the TLOU Esports (TE) Discord Server, that was operational from 2017-2022 with 900+ members. It is currently a <b>work-in-progress</b>. Using Discord's integrated buttons, selects, modals and embeds, with minimal use of slash commands, members can follow trouble-shooting steps, access help articles, and contact support via a ticketing system, if they require assistance on the TLOU Esports website or discord server.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="../images/Avatar_at_computer_desk.png"; alt="Jade's Habbo avatar sitting at a computer desk"; style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 20px">
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>There is a bot-posted message in the Discord #contact-support channel, with a select menu that members can click on, and choose which category they require help with.</li>
    <li>Depending on the category chosen and by utilising hidden ephemeral messages, the bot then will take the user through some trouble-shooting steps, or will ask pre-programmed questions, which the user can answer via select menus or buttons, depending on the number of possible answers.</li>
    <li>Once all relevant questions have been answered, the bot will display a guide/help article that is relevant to the member, along with a button to 'contact support' if required. If the bot cannot provide the member with the relevant help information needed, it will direct the member to the 'contact help' stage immediately.</li>
    <li>Upon clicking the 'contact support' botton, a Discord Modal will open, and the form will be different according to the category/type of help needed. For example, if a member needs assistance with their TLOU Esports website account because they aren't able to log in, the Discord Modal will require them to enter details such as their website username, any error codes they have been receiving (if applicable), their email verification code, and a space for extra details. If, for example, a Discord member would like to report another member on Discord, the Discord Modal will only request the username of the member they would like to report, the reason, and a space for screenshots/links to proof if applicable.</li>
    <li>When a new request to contact support has been made, the bot will create a private channel under a catergory called "New Tickets". The channel will be called the category name, followed by a ticket number (For example, "Account-0035). A hidden ephemeral message will display in the chat with a link to the user's new ticket channel. The bot will post the details of the Modal, along with a log of steps taken/questions asked before the member reached the 'contact support' stage. The bot will also tag staff members with the relevant role (for example, "@Website Admin Support").</li>
    <li>Staff members have access to use buttons in the ticket: "claim", "save", "refer" or "close". "Claim" means that one specific staff member has decided to handle the ticket, meaning other staff members can view the ticket but no longer type in it. This will also move the channel from the "New Tickets" category to the "Open Tickets" category. "Save" will keep a copy of the transcript, "refer" will allow the staff member to add another help category to the ticket (for example, if the "Discord" category was added, it would mean staff members with the "Discord Admin" and "Discord Moderator" role would now have access to that ticket), and "close" will send the ticket to the "Closed Tickets" category, make the channel read-only, and allow for options to be re-opened or deleted. Clicking "delete" will only work if a copy of the transcript has already been saved.</li>
  </ul>
